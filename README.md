## Project's goal:

Web App to share notes in groups/project where it is visible to the group/project users so to keep track of unique/specific code changes required for that group or project.

Created with the goal to better help me with registry of unique stuff related to specific projects that can be forgotten or lost to time where I can add member to the project and shares this notes or tippets.
